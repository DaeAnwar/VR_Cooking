    steps:
    - Preheat an oven to 350 degrees. Separate HALF your total eggs. Set the egg
      whites into a stand mixer with a whip attachment and set the egg yolks aside
      for later. Whip the egg white to stiff peaks and set them aside in a small
      bowl.
    - Wipe your mixing bowl clean. Place in the egg yolks set aside earlier and whip
      them until they thicken and become a light, opaque yellow (this can take up
      to 5 minutes). Then, whip in the almond flour until you have a crumbly paste.
    - Whip into the mixing bowl your remaining whole eggs, almond milk, and salt.
      Once fully mixed, remove your bowl from your stand mixer. Use a spatula or
      hand whisk to gently fold in the stiff egg whites you set aside earlier.
    - Line a 12-count muffin tin with cupcake liners. Remove the rounded ends of
      your hot dogs. Slice each hot dog into 4 pieces (one piece for each muffin
      tin). Place each piece of hot dog standing up in the center of each muffin
      tin.
    - "Use a spoon or scoop to transfer the liquid batter over each hot dog, filling
      each cupcake liner about \xBE full."
    - Bake the corn dog bites for 25-28 minutes, until you seen golden brown tops.
      Enjoy with your favorite mustard or a squirt of ketchup!

    description: "This creamy Keto vanilla BULLETPROOF\xAE coffee recipe is rich
      in fats, frothy plant-based milk, and a hint of sweet vanilla. This Keto vanilla
      butter coffee makes a great fat-fueled breakfast option to kickstart your day.
      Alternatively, this is perfect served with a slice of low-carb cake as an afternoon
      treat!\n\n### What ingredients are in this Keto vanilla butter latte?\n\nThis
      Keto vanilla BULLETPROOF\xAE coffee is prepared with hot almond milk infused
      with sweet vanilla extract. The milk is then blended with instant coffee and
      a hearty helping of unsalted butter, before being blitzed until super frothy!
      We have used a handheld stick blender to froth and blend our Keto coffee, however,
      you may use a freestanding blender for this if preferred.\n\n### Here are some
      tips to make Keto vanilla butter coffee?\n\nThis Keto BULLETPROOF\xAE coffee
      provides a generous serving of fats from unsalted butter. If preferred you
      may swap the butter for coconut oil or BULLETPROOF\xAE brain octane oil (MCT
      Oil) or even a blend of fats. You may also swap the erythritol for your preference
      in low-carb sweetener or omit it entirely if desired. Please be sure to adjust
      your macros for any changes made.\n\n### Can you use freshly brewed coffee
      in this Keto recipe?\n\nWhile this recipe calls for instant coffee, you can
      definitely substitute it for espresso or freshly brewed coffee, just make sure
      its strong.\n\nBULLETPROOF\xAE is a registered trademark owned by Bulletproof
      Digital, Inc."

      and char lines appear. Keep warm until ready to serve.

      dice the bell pepper. Add to the pan along with the onion, cooking for 4-5
      minutes until tender or until the chorizo is cooked through and golden brown.
    - Add the spinach to the skillet and stir through until just wilted.
    - Divide the chorizo mixture between the two zucchini boats to serve.

    steps:
    - Preheat an oven to 350 degrees and line a sheet tray with aluminum foil or
      simply grease it. Spiralize a large zucchini, and break up the spirals slightly
      with your fingers.
    - "Divide the zucchini into 4 sections (just slightly over 2 oz. each), and arrange
      them into \u201Cnests\u201D on your sheet tray. Create a small space in the
      center of each nest. Then, drizzle the olive oil gently across the zucchini."
    - "Crack an egg into each zucchini nest. Sprinkle about \xBC tsp each of the
      salt and pepper over each bird nest."
    - Bake the bird nests for approx 20 minutes. This is enough time for the eggs
      to fully cook and the zucchini to turn just slightly golden on the edges. Allow
      the tray to cool for 2-3 minutes before transferring the finished recipe to
      plates with a spatula.
    - You may cook the bird nests for less than 20 minutes, if you want runnier eggs!

      time to draw out the juices.
    - Trim any unwanted fat from your chicken, and chop the chicken into 1-inch cubes.
    - Heat the olive oil in a medium sized pan on medium-high heat. Toss in the chicken
      and black pepper, and cook these ingredients until the chicken just cooks through.
    - Use a wooden spoon to move the chicken the the outer edges of the pan and turn
      the heat to very low. Place the peanut butter, chili sauce, and soy sauce in
      the exposed center of the pan.
    - Let the heat melt the peanut butter slightly, then stir and combine the chicken
      and sauce into a consistent and creamy mixture.
    - Finally, chop the cilantro and basil and toss these with the chicken.
    - Serve the hot chicken with the cool slaw and two lime wedges. You can add extra
      cilantro as a garnish at your discretion. Enjoy!

    description: "If you are looking for a quick and easy recipe for your busy weeknights,
      then you should end your search here. This Keto steak fajita recipe is tangy,
      juicy, and slightly spicy. It requires 10 minutes of active prep time and another
      10 minutes of cooking. You can prepare all the elements the night before and
      have dinner ready in no time.\n\nThe steak is taken to the next level by marinating
      it in chili powder, minced garlic, lime juice, cumin powder, and olive oil.
      You can let it marinate for as little as 30 minutes, or ideally, overnight.
      This leaves the steak juicy, tender, and highly flavorful.\n\nMost Keto steak
      fajitas are cooked on the pan or grill, while this recipe uses an unconventional
      method. The foil pack method is an easy, fast, and fuss-free way for cooking
      Keto fajitas. First, you must preheat your oven to the highest setting, at
      least 425 Fahrenheit. Then, you must portion out the seasoned vegetables into
      the center of two 12\u201Dx12\u201D pieces of foil, and top them with the marinated
      steak. Tightly wrap the foil around the steak and vegetables and bake for 6-8
      minutes, depending on how you like your steak.\n\n### What can you serve this
      fajita with?\n\nSome tasty toppings include sliced avocado, guacamole, sour
      cream, fresh herbs, and lemon/lime juice. All these options complement the
      steak fajita flavors and add freshness.  For sides, you can serve this dish
      with cauliflower rice, steamed broccoli, or Keto tortillas.\n\n### Are fajitas
      Keto?\n\nNot all fajita recipes are Keto-friendly, but this one is. This chili
      lime steak fajita contains only 4g of net carbs per serving but carries tons
      of flavor. The quantities of the onions and peppers used are enough to shine
      through without sabotaging your daily carb allowance."

      needs their protein in the morning without eating meat! To fill the casserole
      are yummy green slices of zucchini squash and bell pepper for a mild, peppery
      taste. No casserole is complete without melted cheese on top!

    steps:
    - Preheat an oven to 350 degrees. Quarter your zucchini into thin slices and
      dice the bell pepper. Toss and combine the veggies in the base of a 2QT glass
      baking dish.
    - Whisk together the remaining ingredients except for the cheese. Pour the egg
      mix over the veggies. Gently shake the baking dish until the veggies settle
      in the egg. Arrange the shredded cheese over the casserole.
    - Bake for 35 minutes. After cooling for 5 minutes, you can slice squares or
      rectangles for serving.
